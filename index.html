        <h3>The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin?</h3>
        <p>I work as a network administrator for Geil Enterprises, so most of my technology knowledge is on the hardware side, not the software side. There are some projects at work that I need these skills for, but I also need to decide if I should do the projects myself, hire them out, or find an off the shelf package.</p>
        <p>Away from technology, I do a bit of woodworking. I have always fixed and built things but have recently been making wooden pens and segmented bowls. A couple of pictures are below.</p>
        <p>We have a German Shpeherd named Luca. She is the best girl ever.</p>
